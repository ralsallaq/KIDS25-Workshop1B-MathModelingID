    "Q1. Imagine that at the start the entire population get vaccinated with 100% effcacious vaccine what would this do to $S_0$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. If an infection started in a population with a fraction $f$ of the population is vaccinated by 100% protective vaccine, what would be the basic reproduction number in this case? (Hint the infectious contacts for the infected individual = $1\\times(1-f)S0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What would be the effect of lock downs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What startegy would you suggest to decrease $\\beta$? (Hint: think for example what infected and uninfected individuals should do to reduce the probability of transmission in a contact)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can any intervention alter the duration of infectiousness $\\tau$? What is it and how it does that?\n",

    "# Solving the mathematical model\n",
    "\n",
    "* By solving the mathematical model we mean solving for the three state variables $S(t)$ $I(t)$ $R(t)$ for any given values for model parameters: $\\beta$, $\\tau$.\n",
    "* First we need to define the time variable. What do we choose of the unit time? (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, ...etc).\n",
    "* You want the unit time to be as small as possible but also you want to have it large enough for observable changes.\n",
    "* For a disease such as COVID-19, a unit time of **days** would be good.\n",
    "* To solve, we are going to use odeint (ODE integration) from the python package **SCIPY**, which takes a function defining the instantaneous rate of change for the system of differential equations, array of time to integrate over and model paramters. "
